# Graph algorithms
Joint study of some basic graph algorithms.

## Benchmarks and tests
To make fair measurements, we should use the same graphs for comparisons,
therefore use the `models` module, which provides standard graphs models
with the function `graphs`, is mandatory.

To make the benchmarks, we should use the `benchmark` module (as shown in the
`main.rs` file) to get a more precise sample of the average performance of the
algorithms.
